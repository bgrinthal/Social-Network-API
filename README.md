# Social-Media-API
  
  ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)



  ## Description
  
  - What was your motivation?

    MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

    This challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM as well as the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages.

  - What did you learn?
    
    Since most of the foundation of social media applications is data, I learned how to understand, build, and structure the API for it.
